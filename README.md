# *A label for projects and art made without AI.*
<br />
Human-Made is a simple label and/or symbol that can be added to non-AI projects of any kind.

It is a way of highlighting their exclusively human-made nature and the non-use of generative AI.

It operates on the honor system, and is not part of any certifying body.

Human Made is entirely Open-Source and CC-licensed, and was designed to have the same feel as the symbols used by certifying bodies on products (like the Fairtrade or USDA Oranic labels).

### Specifics

#### Who Should Use Human-Made?

If you've finished a project, product, painting, song, article, book, etc. where no AI was used in any generative capacity.

If you want to highlight the artisanal, hand-made, or human-centric quality of something.

If you have qualms about the frenetic adoption of AI tools, as well as the training of said tools using (often copyrighted) human-made things.

If you like the symbol and want to put it on your bikeframe, car (maybe it was human-made too), laptot, etc.

#### Who Can Get Away With Using Human-Made With a Bit of Side-Eye?

If in the course of making something, you've used AI as nothing more than a *research* tool, then (as of mid-2025) you should be fine. While we're sure that sooner rather than later
bias will be intentionally and broadly built into the research capabilities of AI tools (likely driven by advertisers), AI tools still represent valuable research tools in their
ability to cover large swaths of archival material and provide significant insights.

#### Who Cannot Use Human-Made?

If you used AI in any other capacity than as a research tool. This means:

- You used it to write code for you.
- You used it to write for you, or edit your writing.
- You used it to compose music for you.
- You used it to generate images for you.
- etc.

### Usage

There's nothing much to it - just grab a version of the logo or symbol and add it to your project, or its documentation. If you're not a fan of graphics, maybe add a link to this repo.

You can find various examples, sizes, and variations of both the logo and symbol in the `/assets` directory. From there you can simply drag the images to your desktop,
or download the entire folder to your computer. We also have an `imgur` link where the images are also hosted.

We also have some design guidelines around the current logo, font, and symbol in case you want to make versions for different formats, screens, etc.

We highly encourage you to make t-shirts, stickers, posters, anything you think might be a good way to spread the love of human-made things.

### Why?

The use of Generative AI - AI that is used to generate new "things", like code, art, or writing - is beginning to overwhelm all forms of human creativity.

This poses significant challenges to the structure of human work, and by extension our society, our politics, and our future. In some cases, AI-use poses significant security
considerations, like when it's used in safety or life-critical systems. The EU has recently (2024-25) attempted to curtail the use of AI in specific sectors through legislation,
and similar initiatives are being considered worldwide.

That said, **we believe not enough has been done to actively celebrate work that eschews the use of AI-tools**. Celebrating this type of work will undoubtedly result in a greater
recognition and dialogue around the dangers posed by generative AI tools. This dialogue is desperately needed at this point in time.

### Us

Human-Made shares its name with a Japanese clothing brand (which we love), but bears no relation to it.

Human-Made was born at the Interactive Telecommunications Program at NYU, as a way of navigating the increasing use of AI tools in student projects, often in indiscriminate ways.

We thought it might be better to call out projects that remained within the all-human realm rather than interrogate those which leaned heavily on AI, given that at the beginning of 2025, most projects being made at the program already were using AI-generated code.

*For Humans* is just an umbrella for this and other initiatives that we hope will continue to spawn from the program in the coming years.

### License

This is the TLDR:
- You are free to share, copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format.
- The licensor cannot revoke these freedoms as long as you follow the license terms.
- You may not use the material for commercial purposes.
- If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you may not distribute the modified material.
- There are no additional restrictions.

Essentially, don't sell the thing - if you have suggestions about modifications, or variations, or anything of the sort, we hope that you'll contribute to the project. That way we'll grow together, and keep human-made a living, breathing thing.
